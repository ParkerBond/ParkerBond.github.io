    <p style="color:black;"><strong>The University of Georgia has a rich football tradition ever since its first game against Mercer University on <i>January 1892</i> which marked not only Georgia's first victory but also the first occasion a college football game had been played in the deep south. The Following game was equally historic with a game against neighboring Auburn which would soon become one of Georgia's Fiercest rivals and be aptly named as the <u>Deep South's Oldest Rivalry.</u>However such a strong start did not have its obstacles when tragically Fullback Richard Von Albade Gammon was killed by injuries suffered in a game and nearly had the entire program destroyed by a bill banning football in the state. However, it was quickly vetoed by the Governor due to a letter he received from Gammon's Mother urging him not to end it because her son loved the game. Despite setbacks and instability, the program began to grow rapidly into the 20th century.</strong></p>

    <h3><strong> <font color=" Black"><strong> <u> UGA Runningbacks</u></strong> </h3>

    <p> <font color="Black"><strong> The University of Georgia Bulldogs has a long and storied history of legendary runningbacks from <strong> Heisman Winners Frank Sinkwhich </strong> <em>(1940)</em> and <strong> Hershal Walker </strong> <em>(1980)</em> both of whom led the Bulldogs to a national championships. In many ways, UGA Football lives and dies with their high-powered rushing attack even in a modern era that increasingly emphasizes the passing game. UGA running backs have left a strong mark on the history of not just the College Football World but the National Football Leauge with current players such as Todd Gurley III, Nick Chubb, and Sony Michel. </strong> </font></p>
