                <p style="font-family:Georgia">


    <p style="font-family:Georgia"><strong>The University of Georgia has a rich football tradition ever since its first game against Mercer University on <i>January 1892</i> which marked not only Georgia's first victory but also the first occasion a college football game had been played in the deep south. The Following game was equally historic with a game against neighboring Auburn which would soon become one of Georgia's Fiercest rivals and be aptly named as the <em>Deep South's Oldest Rivalry.</em>However such a strong start did not have its obstacles when tragically Fullback Richard Von Albade Gammon was killed by injuries suffered in a game and nearly had the entire program destroyed by a bill banning football in the state. However, it was quickly vetoed by the Governor due to a letter he received from Gammon's Mother urging him not to end it because her son loved the game. Despite setbacks and instability, the program began to grow rapidly into the 20th century.</strong></p>
